Argentina defeated West Germany 3-2 to take the trophy. With one week to go before the World Cup starts in Brazil, The Associated Press takes a look at 10 great stars in the tournament's history. Maradona One the greatest playmakers of all time, Maradona was joint FIFA Player of the 20th Century with Pele. &#xec;El Pibe de Oro&#xee; inspired Argentina to victory in the 1986 tournament. The English will never forgive him for his &#xec;Hand of God&#xee; goal en route to winning the World Cup. And perhaps his own people, the Argentines, will never forgive him for being a terrible coach for the national team at the World Cup four years ago in South Africa. But as player, Maradona was peerless during his heyday, although drug problems marred the end of his career. (AP Photo/Carlo Fumagalli, File)",
